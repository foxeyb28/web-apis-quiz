//WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and my score
/*
// every question will be a:
{
    question: "what does Css stand for?";
    option1: "option here";
    option2: "another example here";
    option3: "this one too";
    correctanswer: "this is right answer";
